> This project was made to demonstrate a school self evaluation tool that is completely offline and built with an internal school standards framework called "StandBasis". It was made using Reactjs for the Frontend UI, AES-GCM-256 is used to write the data entries securely within the database and IndexDB is used as the database. 
TODO: Will be adding a server side implementation for District school owners to see each schools synchronized data metrics after filling the surveys within their respective machines.
